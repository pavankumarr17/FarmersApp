The first visible symptoms are the appearance of white fungal bodies called sphaecelia extending from the glume where seed would normally develop. From these sphaecelia, a sugar-rich exudate known as honeydew flows. The honeydew flows down the panicle and drips onto leaves and the soil. The honeydew contains high populations of macrospores that can infect unfertilized florets or germinate to produce secondary conidia capable of long distance dispersal by wind. Secondary conidia are capable of several cycles of iterative germination maximizing the chance for contact with an unfertilized sorghum floret.

Apply propiconazole and tebuconazole in three to four sprays at 250 g·a.i.·ha−1 and benomyl at 0.2% a.i.

Forage sorghum can be very susceptible to ergot due to asynchronous flowering and fertilization as well as the high prevalence of male sterility. Harvesting prior to full flowering can minimize ergot development and harvest complications that can result from the production of honeydew.
