Seedling wilt or kresek
Water-soaked to yellowish stripes on leaf blades or starting at leaf tips then later increase in lengthand width with a wavy margin
Appearance of bacterial ooze that looks like a milky or opaque dewdrop on young lesions early in the morning
Lessions turn yellow to white as the disease advances
If the cuts end of leaf is kept in water it becomes turbid because of bacterial ooze.

Grow Tolerant varieties (IR 20 IR 72,PONMANI , TKM 6).
Secure disease free seed.
Grow nurseries preferably in isolated upland conditions.
Avoid clipping of seedlings during transplanting.
Balanced fertilization, avoid excess N - application.
Skip N - application at booting (if disease is moderate).
Drain the field (except at flowering stage of the crop).
Destruction of weeds and  collateral hosts.
Avoid flow of water from affected fields.
Maintain proper plant spacing.

Seed treatment with bleaching powder (100g/l) and zinc sulfate (2%) reduce bacterial blight.
Seed treatment - seed soaking for 8 hours in Agrimycin (0.025%) and wettable ceresan (0.05%) followed by hot water treatment for 30 min at 52-54oC;
 seed soaking for 8 hours in ceresan (0.1%) and treat with Streptocyclin (3g in 1 litre);
Spray Streptomycin sulphate + Tetracycline combination 300 g + Copper oxychloride 1.25kg/ha. If necessary repeat 15 days later.
Application of bleaching powder @ 5 kg/ha in the irrigation water is recommended in the kresek stage.
 Foliar spray with copper fungicides alternatively with Strepto-cyclin (250 ppm) to check secondary spread.

Spray fresh cowdung extract 20% twice (starting from initial appearance of the disease and another at fortnightly interval)
Neem oil 60 EC 3% (or) NSKE 5% is recommended for the control of sheath rot, sheath blight, grain discolouration and bacterial blight.
