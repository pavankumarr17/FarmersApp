Charcoal rot first becomes noticeable when corn is in the tassel stage or later. Upper leaves of the corn will dry out.
Infected corn plants have shredded stalks, and the pith will have completely rotted, leaving only stringy vascular strands intact.
The sclerotia of the fungus are small, black and spherical, and are found on and inside the vascular strands, numerous enough to give the internal stalk tissue a grey coloring.
Translocation of water and nutrients are disrupted due to hyphae of the fungi growing intercellularly through the xylem and into the surrounding vascular tissue.
The fungus can grow into the lower internode of the stalk as the plant matures, causing plants to ripen prematurely and weaken their stalks, causing breakage (UC Davis, 2014).
Lodging is often caused by decomposition of stalk tissue due to infection and can result in yield loss.
 
Follow crop rotation
Avoidance of water stress at flowering time reduced disease incidence
Avoid nutrient stress.
 
Apply potash @ 80 kg/ha in endemic areas
Soil application of   P. fluorescens (or) T. viride @ 2.5 kg / ha + 50 kg of well decomposed FYM (mix 10 days before application) or sand at 30 days after sowing
