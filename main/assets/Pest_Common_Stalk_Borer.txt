The stalk borer adult is a dull, grayish-brown moth that
commonly has several white or silver spots in two rows across the front wings. There is a faint whitish line across the wing near the outer edge. The hind wings are dull brownish-gray. The moth’s wingspan is approximately 1 to 11⁄4 inches. Common stalk borer larvae are distinctive in appearance.

Any weed control method that helps eliminate grasses
will reduce the number of potential stalk borer egg-laying
sites, reducing the probability of stalk borer damage the next year.Control of grassy weeds is important in keeping a stalk borer infestation from becoming more and more of a problem each year. Planting date may have some influence on the degree of injury from common stalk borers. Since smaller plants are more heavily damaged, earlier planting may allow corn to escape some of the most severe damage.
If most common stalk borer damage is next to grassy field
borders and waterways, burning these areas before eggs hatch has been shown to reduce common stalk borer populations.The best option is to burn these areas in late winter, before the grass begins to grow. At this time all eggs have been laid, and the soil will be bare and subject to erosion for the shortest time. Also, this timing has the least effect on bird populations that have not yet begun to nest.

Insecticides may be mixed with fast-acting herbicides being used to burn down early season weeds, or applied several days after use of slower-acting herbicides.

Of the currently available Bt corn hybrids, only
those expressing the VIP3A Bt protein provide control of
common stalk borers. Hybrids expressing the Cry1Ab or
Cry1F Bt protein provide suppression of common stalk
borer.Suppression indicates that a lower level of mortality is expected than for insects labeled for control.
