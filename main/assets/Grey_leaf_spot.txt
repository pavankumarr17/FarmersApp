The initial symptoms of grey leaf spot emerge as small, dark, moist spots that are encircled by a thin, yellow radiance (lesions forming). The tissue within the “spot" begins to die as spot size increases into longer, narrower leaf lesions. Although initially brownish and yellow, the characteristic grey color that follows is due to the production of grey fungal spores (conidia) on the lesion surface. 

Tillage can reduce the risk of GLS when the residue is incorporated into the soil and decomposition results. However, when other GLS management measures are employed; e.g., crop rotation, the use of tolerant hybrids, and the application of fungicides, the benefits from reduced tillage (e.g., increased water retention, reduced erosion) outweigh the negative impacts of GLS.
Rotation to crops other than corn for at least one year in low risk fields (minimum two years in high risk fields) may minimize the severity of GLS.
