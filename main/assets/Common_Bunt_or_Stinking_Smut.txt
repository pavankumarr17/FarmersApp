The symptoms of common bunt and stinking smut generally are not apparent until heading. Diseased plants may be stunted, and bunted heads may be a darker color of green and may stay green longer than normal plants. Heads of infected plants may also be smaller and their numbers reduced. After heading, diseased heads can appear slightly open due to the expansion of infected kernels causing the glumes to spread apart. In infected heads, diseased kernels, or bunt balls, are dull, grayish-brown in color and are filled with dark brown spore masses. The heads rupture at harvest and release spores that have a fishy odor due to the chemical trimethylamine.

Early planting when soil temperatures are warm and unfavorable for infection can provide partial control of common bunt.  However, planting early increases the risk of other diseases such as wheat streak mosaic virus and barley yellow dwarf.
