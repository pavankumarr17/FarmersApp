Individual plants of cereal crops (e.g. wheat) produce multiple stems, and each stem produces a single seed spike which emerges at the end of the stem.  The spike is composed of multiple spikelets positioned on alternate sides of the spike’s stem.  Each spikelet is composed of flowering structures where seed develops.  The first symptoms of Fusarium head blight occur shortly after flowering. Diseased spikelets exhibit premature bleaching as the pathogen grows and spreads within the head 

Planting wheat after corn or sor-
ghum should be avoided as these crops are hosts of FHB
causing fungi. Corn residue survives longer than small
grains residue. Therefore, FHB tends to be more severe
in wheat planted after corn, especially in reduced or no-
tillage cropping systems. Continuous cropping of wheat
also should be avoided. Irrigation management to allow
the crop canopy to dry between irrigations can reduce
disease severity.

Two fungicides registered for control
of FHB are prothioconazole (Proline) and
propiconazole (Tilt). These fungicides suppress FHB.
They do not completely control the disease. Fungicide
application should be timed to protect the head. Optimal
timing is at approximately 15 percent flowering (Feekes
10.51). Thorough coverage of heads is essential for maxi-
mum suppression of FHB.
