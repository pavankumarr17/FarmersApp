The entire inflorescence, except the rachis, is replaced by masses of smut spores.
These black teliospores often are blown away by the wind, leaving only the bare rachis and remnants of other floral structures

To avoid loose smut in the next crop, grain from fields with loose smut should not be used as seed. A high percentage of grain infected by the loose smut fungus will lead to a high incidence of the disease

Treat the seed with Vitavax @ 2g/kg seed before sowing.
Burry the infected ear heads in the soil, so that secondary spread is avoided.

For a seed treatment fungicide to be effective, clean the grain before treatment and ensure thorough coverage of the grain with fungicide. It is recommended that grain be treated by a commercial seed treater. The most effective long-term solution to loose smut and common bunt is to always plant certified, fungicide-treated seed.
