COTTON
DESCRIPTION
Cotton plant is a shrub and is widely cultivated in over 90 countries for its fiber and secondly for seeds. About 2,5% of world cropland is planted with cotton. It is an angiosperm, dicotyledonous plant, which belongs to the family of Malvaceae. It is native to Asia and Africa.  Exactly as it happens with tomatoes, peppers and other plants, cotton is natively a perennial plant, but nowadays we cultivate it as annual. This means that we sow the seeds during spring, we harvest the cotton during autumn, and then we plow and destroy the plants, so that we can sow again next spring in an empty field.


CULTIVATION
The soil is ploghed and spring cotton seeds are planted in rows by hand or machine.
About two months after planting, flower buds called squares appear on the cotton plants.
In another three weeks, the blossoms open. 
Under the late summer sun the fibers continue to expand until they split the boll apart. 
The cotton dries when exposed to the sun. Now it’s ready to be harvested.
Mechanical picker spindles pick and twist the raw seed cotton fiber from the burrs that are attached to plants’ stems. Doffers then remove the seed cotton fiber from the spindles and knock it into a basket on the back of the picker.
