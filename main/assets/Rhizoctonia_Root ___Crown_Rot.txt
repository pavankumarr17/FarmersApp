Rhizoctonia root rot is characterized by sudden, permanent wilting, and complete collapse of leaves and petioles. Root symptoms begin as circular to oval, localized dark lesions that coalesce to form larger rotted areas of the root as disease progresses. Extent of rotted tissue often is restricted to external layers of the root and does not generally penetrate into the interior until very advanced stages of disease

practices that introduce soil into the crowns should be minimized. Crop rotation with small grains may help to reduce the number of pathogen survival structures in soil. Controlling susceptible plants like pigweed will also reduce disease incidence in beets

Seed treatments with various fungicides will control damping-off. Applications of the strobilurin fungicide Quadris, (azoxystrobin) is now available that has been demonstrated to protect plants from the crown rot phase of the disease
