Cotyledons seldom wilt before advanced stages, so this is a diagnostic symptom along with the thin, dark stem. The chronic phase is characterized by foliage that wilts, turns a dull green and eventually chlorotic. Plants may recover at night, but are more prone to wilt again during the day. Leaves may also appear scorched and become dry and brittle. Root symptoms begin as yellowish-brown, water-soaked lesions that extend into the interior of the root. As disease advances, lesions become dark brown to black. Infection can occur anywhere on the root, but usually occurs as a tip rot. 

Controlling several weeds that can serve as hosts such as pigweed, kochia, and lambsquarters will also help to avoid large population increases in soils.

Seed treated with the fungicide Tachigaren will protect seedlings from the black root phase. This will last for 4-6 weeks, but will not provide season-long protection. No fungicides are available for the chronic root rot phase later in the season.
