The first visible symptoms are the appearance of small non-diagnostic lesions on the lower leaves. These lesions elongate and form the typical diagnostic Sooty Stripe lesions having pronounced reddish-brown lesion margins (on most hybrids) with yellow halos. Lesions may expand and run together, resulting in serious leaf blight. Within the center of mature lesions, rows of very small black bodies form; these black sclerotia give the lesion a "sooty" appearance and can be rubbed from the surface leaving a smudge on your finger. When the weather is favorable the disease progresses up the plant and lesions may occur on all leaves of the plant.
