RAGI
DESCRIPTION
Finger millet is a robust tillering grass which grows in tufts. It has erect, light green stems. The leaves of the plant are dark green, linear and mainly smooth with some hair along the leaf edges. The inflorescence of the plant is a cluster of 3–26 ‘fingers’ composed of dense spikelets where the grain, or seed, is produced. Finger millet can reach 1.7 m (5.6 ft) in height and is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season. 

CULTIVATION:
The land is prepared separately for irrigated and rainfed conditions. 
In areas with a rainfall of 60 to 75 cm, ragi is cultivated as a rainfed crop. So the field should be deeply ploughed for moisture conservation.
But in irrigated crop, plough the field immediately at the arrival of monsoon until gets fine tilth.
