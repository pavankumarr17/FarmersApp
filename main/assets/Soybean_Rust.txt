Lesions can also develop on petioles, pods and stems. Symptom development occurs rapidly once the plant starts flowering and can result in significant levels of defoliation under favorable environmental conditions. Lesions first appear as small yellow and irregularly shaped spots. As the disease progresses, lesions enlarge to 1/16th to 1/12th of an inch in diameter, and are tan to dark reddish brown in color. Within each lesion are a few to several volcano-shaped uredinia (spore producing structures). As rust severity increases, plants prematurely lose their leaves and commonly mature early. Lesions from soybean rust can appear similar to other foliar diseases of soybean and can be confused with brown spot and bacterial pustule.

Planting date and maturity may influence the impact of soybean rust in some regions.  Research has not been done in this area.
