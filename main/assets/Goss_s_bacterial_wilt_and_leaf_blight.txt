The first identifiable characteristic is the development of dark green to black discontinuous water-soaked spots, sometimes called "freckles" because of their appearance, near the edges of expanding lesions. The bacteria can also create an exudate or â€˜ooze' on the surfaces of the leaf which is the second identifiable characteristic. When dried the exudate may glisten and appear shiny on the leaf surface similar to varnish. The disease can also have a systemic wilt phase in which the bacteria infect the vascular system and move within the plant. Infection may cause discoloration of the water-conducting elements (photo) and eventually a slimy stalk rot that can lead to wilting and plant death.

Since the bacterium survives in infested residue, and
poorly in or on soil, any type of tillage that buries residue to
encourage decomposition may be effective in reducing the
rate of new infections. Rotating out of corn into other crops
such as soybean, dry bean, small grains or alfalfa will help
reduce primary inoculum sources in corn residue. Additional
hosts for the pathogen include green foxtail, shattercane and
barnyard grass; therefore weed control also may provide an
effective method for reducing inoculum

Use of partially resistant hybrids is the most practical means of disease control. However, resistance does not imply immunity from disease, but yield losses should be reduced compared to that in susceptible cultivars.
