Brown spots on the margins of the cotyledons characterize plants infected early in the growing season. Young plants may be stunted and if the infection reaches the growing point, they may die. Symptoms in later growth stages include angular lesions, which begin as small yellow to brown spots on the leaves. The centers of the spots will turn a dark reddish-brown and dry out. A yellowish-green "halo" will appear around the edge of water soaked tissue that surrounds the lesions. Eventually the lesions will fall out of the leaf and the foliage will appear ragged. Generally young leaves are most susceptible to blight infection. Lesions can also occur on the pods causing the seeds to become shriveled and discolored.

Crop rotation can be an effective method to avoid inoculum from a previously infected crop. Incorporating crop residue by tillage will reduce the amount of inoculum available in the spring to infect plants but there are moisture and erosion issues to be considered. To prevent the spread of disease, limit cultivation to times when the foliage is dry.

Copper fungicides are labeled for con-
trol of bacterial blight on soybeans but need to be applied
early in the disease cycle to be effective.
