The fungus affects the crop at young stage.
Early symptoms are oval, water-soaked spots on leaves.
Mature symptoms are characteristic cigar shaped lesions that are 3 to 15cm long.
Lesions are elliptical and tan in color, developing distinct dark areas as they mature that are associated with fungal sporulation.
Lesions typically first appear on lower leaves, spreading to upper leaves and the ear sheaths as the crop matures.
Under severe infection, lesions may coalesce, blighting the entire leaf

Tillage methods that promote decomposition of crop debris reduce initial inoculum. Rotation with non-grass crops and elimination of weedy grass hosts are recommended . On maize, early sidedressing of N reduced disease but N has also been shown to increase susceptibility. 
Mixed planting with soyabean reduced maize infection.Mixing resistant sorghum with a susceptible cultivar increased yield of the susceptible cultivar by 0.55% for each 1% increase of resistant plants. Plant density was found to be a factor in disease control.

Rogue out affected plants.
Resistant cultivers  â€“ Deccan, VL 42, Prabhat, KH-5901, PRO-324, PRO-339, ICI-701, F- 7013, F-7012, PEMH 1, PEMH 2, PEMH 3, Paras, Sartaj, Deccan 109, COH-6.
Soil application of   P. fluorescens (or) T. viride @ 2.5 kg / ha + 50 kg of well decomposed FYM (mix 10 days before application) or sand at 30 days after sowing
Spray Matalaxyl 1000 g / Mancozeb 2 g/liter at 10 days interval after first  appearance of the disease

Bacillus subtilis applied at inoculation provided the best control 
A controlled light regime in glasshouse or growth chambers is suggested as a control method
