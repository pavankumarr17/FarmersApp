Larval feeding first leads to leaf scarification and then to make small pin holes in the opening of leaves. The 3rd instar larvae migrate to thebase of the plant and bore inside leading to the production of central shoot starts drying i.etypical stem borer ‘deadheart’. In mature plants, the larvae bore thestems and make tunnels while feeding on the internal tissues.

Ploughing of the stubbles of the previous crops is more important to prevent the carryover of the inoculums from the previous crop.When the seedlings grow to standard size, earthing up the crop minimized its infestation.

Spray phorate 10% CG @ 1 l/ha at every 20 days interval after germination.
