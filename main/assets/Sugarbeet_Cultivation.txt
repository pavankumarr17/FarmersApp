SUGARBEET
DESCRIPTION
 The sugar beet has a conical, white, fleshy root (a taproot) with a flat crown. The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by photosynthesis in the leaves and is then stored in the root.The root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% pulp.The exact sugar content can vary between 12% and 21% sugar, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a cash crop. The pulp, insoluble in water and mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin, is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and molasses, add another 10% to the value of the harvest.


CULTIVATION
Beets grow best in deep, moist, well-drained soil with a near neutral pH.
Amend heavy clay soil well with organic compost to improve drainage. Sandy soil should be supplemented with compost to assist with water retention if it drains too quickly. 
They should be kept evenly moist, but never “swamped.”
