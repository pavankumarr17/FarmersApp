Symptoms of take-all are most noticeable near heading and include plant stunting and early maturation. Circular patches of stunted, yellow plants may appear during the early growth stages, commonly occurring in wetter areas of the field. Infected plants tend to be yellow in color and produce fewer tillers (Figure 9.6). Because plants are killed prematurely, bleached and sterile heads are produced (“white heads”). The white heads may be void of grain or produce only a few shriveled kernels. Wet weather promotes fungal growth that blackens the dead, white heads.
