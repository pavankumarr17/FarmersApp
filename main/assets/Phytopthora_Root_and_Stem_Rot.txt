The stem rot phase is easily identified by the dark brown color on the exterior surface of the stem and lower branches. Discoloration of the stem extends from below the soil to 6 inches or more above the soil line. The taproot turns dark brown and the entire root system may be rotted. Leaves on older infected plants become chlorotic between the veins followed by general wilting and death

In many cases tilling can improve soil drainage. Compacted soils will also result in increased disease levels. Crop rotation should also be done, as continuous soybean production will increase fungal inoculum and promote development of new biotypes or races.

Seed treatment fungicides can be used for management of early season seed rot and damping off caused by P. sojae. The compounds labeled for control are ethaboxam, metalaxyl, and mefenoxam. Mefenoxam isone of the chemical compounds that has been isolated from metalaxyl and is the most active part of metalaxyl products. As a result of isolating the active component, products containing mefenoxam are typically used at half the active ingredient rate of metalaxyl products.
