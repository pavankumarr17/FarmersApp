Symptoms of tan spot appear in the spring as oval to diamond-shaped, elongated brown leaf spots that are often darker in the center and yellow around the outside . The earlier the plant is infected, the more distinct the yellow border usually becomes, creating an "eye-spot" appearance. As the disease progresses, more spots develop on the leaves and start to coalesce, producing large areas of dead tissue. In addition, tan spot may kill leaves after heading, resulting in the early death of plants. In the late summer (August), characteristic, small, black fruiting bodies called pseudo-thecia appear on the stubble.

A unique three-year conservation tillage rotation system called ecofarming (ecofallow) can be used to reduce the threat of tan spot. Ecofarming is a crop rotation system of controlling weeds and conserving soil moisture with minimum disturbance of crop residue. In this system, corn or sorghum is seeded directly into winter wheat stubble in a winter wheat-grain sorghum or corn-fallow rotation. In the ecofarming system a crop is planted directly into the residue of a different crop, rather than into the residue of the same crop. This crop rotation-fallow system effectively breaks disease cycles which involve host specific pathogens such the tan spot fungus that survive in crop residue.

In the ecofarming system,
a crop is planted directly into the residue of a different crop,
rather than into the residue of the same crop. This crop
rotation-fallow system effectively breaks disease cycles that
