The first visible symptoms are the appearance of small non-diagnostic lesions on the lower leaves. These lesions may occur anywhere on the leaf. As the lesions mature they become circular or target shaped on the interior of the leaf and semicircular on the leaf margins. Some zonate lesions do not have a target appearance and can be confused with physiological spotting or genotype-environment interactions. On some hybrids, lesion appearance and size is variable. Lesions elongate, run together, and whole leaves may be blighted. When the weather is favorable the disease progresses up the plant and lesions may occur on all leaves of the plant.

Avoid overhead irrigation and minimize leaf wetness. Crop rotations of four years or longer are recommended. Collect plant residues and destroy them at a distance of the field by burying or burning them.
