External root symptoms are not present. However, vascular elements in taproots exhibit a reddish-brown necrosis when viewed in cross-section or longitudinal section. Plants regain turgor at night but wilt quickly again during the day, due to vascular elements being blocked with the pathogen. Fusarium root rot also exhibits symptoms that consist of wilting, yellowing and vascular necrosis, but is additionally characterized by a black tip rot at the distal end of the taproot. Often the tip is rotted so severely that only remnants of the vascular elements remain.

planting early into cool soils, and avoiding unnecessary irrigations. Controlling several weeds that can serve as hosts such as pigweed, Kochia, and lambsquarters will also help to avoid large population increases in soils.

Mycostop is a biological fungicide that will safely protect crops against wilt caused by Fusarium. Approved for use in organic crop production, it can be applied as a soil spray or drench (1-2 gm/ 100 sq ft) to seedlings, ornamentals and vegetables. Apply sufficient water during application to move Mycostop into the root zone.
