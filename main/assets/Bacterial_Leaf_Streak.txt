Symptoms on infected plants may look similar to other common diseases, sometimes causing confusion and misdiagnoses. Narrow stripes between leaf veins may initially look like the common fungal disease, gray leaf spot. Lesions can be brown, orange, and/or yellow and are often yellow when backlit. Lesions usually have slightly wavy edges in contrast to the smooth, linear lesion margins of gray leaf spot.

Sanitation practices such as cleaning debris from combines and other equipment between fields can help slow its spread to unaffected fields.
In some cropping systems use of crop rotation or tillage may help degrade infected corn debris and reduce the surviving bacteria.
